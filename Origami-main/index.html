              The "Gamucha" is one of the most easily recognizable cultural symbols of the Assamese people
              and is an integral part of almost all socio-religious ceremonies. It is considered as an
              honorary piece of cloth commonly used for felicitation in Assam .
              The "Gamucha", a white rectangular piece of cotton hand woven cloth with primarily 
              a red border on three sides and red woven motifs on the fourth (in addition to red, 
              other colors are also used) is put to many uses. It is used as a towel, as a waistcloth
              or a loincloth; a Bihu dancer wraps it around the head in a knot, it is also hung around
              the neck at the prayer hall and thrown over the shoulder to signify social status or 
              respect. "Gamucha"s", also known as "Bihuwaans", are offered during Bihu as a token of
              love. Significantly the "Gamucha" is used equally by all, irrespective of religious and
              ethnic backgrounds.

            <p>
              The "Jaapi" is a traditional conical hat from Assam which is made from tightly woven 
              bamboo and/or cane and "Tokoupaat", a type of large palm leaf. The word "Jaapi"derives
              from Jaap meaning a bundle Tokou leaves.
              "Jaapi" is worn in a style of Bihu dance, used as protection against the elements,
              offered as a sign of respect in ceremonies, and placed as a decorative item around 
              the house, especially near the front door as a welcome sign. Plain "Jaapi" were used
              by farmers for protection from the sun and rain while working in the fields, while ornate "Jaapi" 
              were worn as a status symbol by Assamese royalty and nobility.

                <p>
                  Satriya Nritya is the classic dance form of Assam which represents the 
                  Satriya culture, the basis of the religious and cultural fabric of Assam.
                  It is one among eight principal classical Indian dance traditions. Whereas 
                  some of the other traditions have been revived in the recent past, Satriya 
                  has remained a living tradition since its creation by the founder of Vaishnavism 
                  in Assam, the great saint Srimanta Sankardeva, in 15th century Assam.
                  The core of Satriya Nritya has usually been mythological stories. This was 
                  an artistic way of presenting mythological teachings to the people in 
                  an accessible, immediate, and enjoyable manner.

                  In the passage of more than a hundred years of their settlement in Assam 
                  the tea tribes have developed a synthesised form of dance called "Chah Baganar Jumur Nach". 
                  This is a beautiful dance to watch. A visitor to any tea garden can easily see this dance.
                  The tea tribes have a synthesized form of dance called "Jhumur Nach", performed by girls 
                  and boys together, or, sometimes by the girls alone, with precision of footwork while 
                  tightly clasping each other's waist.

                  Bhortal Nritya, an extension of Sankari culture of Barpeta evolved 
                  from the classical dance form of that particular district of Assam 
                  and was developed by Narahari Burha Bhakat, a well-known Satriya artist.
                  Six to ten dancers perform this dance and produce a good number of attractive 
                  formations displaying the cymbals. This dance can be performed in 
                  larger groups as well. It is performed to a very fast beat. This beat is 
                  known as "7hiya Nom". The dance can be seen during festive occasions in and 
                  around Barpeta and Guwahati.
